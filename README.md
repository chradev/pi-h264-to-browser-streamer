Fork of [dans98/pi-h264-to-browser](https://github.com/dans98/pi-h264-to-browser/) that supports the new picamera2 Python library.

### About

Stream hardware encoded h.264 from a Raspberry Pi equiped with a V1, V2, or HQ camera module, directly to a browser. Latency is good, maybe 1sec. If you want to go realtime, find a webrtc solution.

For installation instructions, [check out our blogpost](https://kroket.io/blog/pi4-h264-camera-web.html)
